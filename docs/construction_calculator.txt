This project is a Construction Materials Calculator application built using Expo and React Native, designed to assist users in estimating material needs for construction projects and comparing prices from various suppliers.

Project Parameters and Core Functionality
The application's primary function revolves around a "Calculator" tab where users input project dimensions:

Length (feet)
Width (feet)
Depth (inches)
Users can then select a Material Type from predefined options such as Concrete, Sand, Gravel, and Mulch. Each material type has associated coverage rates and a list of simulated suppliers with their brands, bag sizes, prices, delivery fees, and stock availability.

Upon calculation, the app provides:

The estimated volume of material required.
A supplier price comparison, highlighting the "BEST DEAL" among available options.
The ability to add specific supplier options to a "Shopping List."
Beyond the calculator, the application includes:

A "Suppliers" tab that lists various construction material suppliers, displaying their ratings, distances, delivery fees, and a selection of their available materials.
A "Shopping List" tab where users can view, update quantities of, and remove items from their compiled list. It also calculates a total estimated cost, including tax and delivery fees.
A "Profile" tab for user-specific information and settings.
Plan to Reimplement the Cart for Persistent State
Previously, the "Add to List" functionality from the Calculator tab did not correctly update the Shopping List tab because the shopping list data was not being shared or persisted across components. To address this, the plan is to implement a centralized state management solution using React Context:

Create ShoppingListContext.tsx: A new file will be created under a context directory. This file will define a React Context, a ShoppingListProvider component, and a useShoppingList custom hook.

The ShoppingListProvider will manage the cartItems state (an array of CartItem objects) using React's useState hook.
It will expose functions (addItem, updateQuantity, removeItem) that allow components to modify the cartItems state.
The removeItem function within this context will include the confirmation Alert dialog that was previously removed during debugging.
Wrap the Tab Navigator (app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx): The Tabs component, which defines the main navigation structure, will be wrapped with the ShoppingListProvider. This ensures that all screens within the tab navigation (Calculator, Suppliers, Shopping List, Profile) have access to the shared shopping list state and its management functions.

Modify the Calculator Tab (app/(tabs)/index.tsx):

The CalculatorTab will import and use the useShoppingList hook to gain access to the addItem function from the context.
The addToShoppingList function will be updated to call the context's addItem function, passing the selected material and supplier details.
Any local state related to addedItems will be removed, as the shared context will now manage the overall shopping list.
Modify the Cart Tab (app/(tabs)/cart.tsx):

The CartTab will also import and use the useShoppingList hook.
It will retrieve the cartItems array, updateQuantity function, and removeItem function directly from the context.
The local cartItems state and its useState and setCartItems calls will be removed, as the data will now be sourced from the shared context.
Existing calls to updateQuantity and removeItem within this component will be updated to use the functions provided by the context.
Debugging Efforts to Date
Our recent debugging efforts primarily focused on resolving an issue with the trash button in the Shopping List tab not functioning correctly.

Initially, the button's onPress handler was not effectively triggering the item removal or the associated confirmation dialog.
We utilized console.log statements to verify that the onPress event was indeed being registered when the button was tapped.
The immediate fix involved modifying the removeItem function in app/(tabs)/cart.tsx to directly remove the item from the local state without an intermediate confirmation dialog. This confirmed that the underlying removal logic was sound.
While this resolved the immediate issue of the trash button not working, it highlighted the need for a robust state management solution, leading to the current plan for implementing React Context. The confirmation dialog will be re-introduced as part of the context's removeItem function.
Context of Real Data Integration
Currently, all supplier and material data within the application (e.g., materialTypes in app/(tabs)/index.tsx and suppliers in app/(tabs)/suppliers.tsx) is hardcoded directly into the source files. This approach is suitable for a prototype or demonstration, allowing for rapid development and testing of the user interface and core logic without requiring a live backend.

For a production-ready application, this data would need to be integrated with real, dynamic data sources. This typically involves:

Backend Database: Setting up a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, with Supabase being a preferred option for Bolt projects) to store comprehensive supplier information, product catalogs, pricing, and stock levels.
API Endpoints: Developing API endpoints (e.g., using Supabase Edge Functions or other serverless functions) to allow the frontend application to fetch and potentially update this data.
Asynchronous Data Fetching: Modifying components like CalculatorTab and SuppliersTab to fetch data asynchronously from these API endpoints when the application loads or when specific actions are performed.
The current hardcoded data serves as a functional placeholder, demonstrating the application's capabilities and design, and is structured in a way that facilitates a smooth transition to live data integration in the future.

Add new feature
Please implement the plan for reimplementing Shopping List with React Context to persist and preserve the data across tabs

I'll implement a React Context solution to persist shopping list data across tabs. This will ensure that items added from the calculator are preserved when switching between tabs.

Implement Shopping List Context for Data Persistence

Undo

contexts/ShoppingListContext.tsx
app/_layout.tsx
app/(tabs)/cart.tsx
app/(tabs)/index.tsx
app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx
I've successfully implemented a React Context solution for the shopping list that provides persistent data across all tabs. Here's what I've added:

Key Features Implemented:
ShoppingListContext: A centralized state management system that handles all cart operations
Data Persistence: Cart items are now preserved when switching between tabs
Smart Item Management: Prevents duplicate items and updates quantities for existing items
Real-time Updates: The cart tab badge shows the current item count
Seamless Integration: All existing functionality is preserved while adding persistence
What Changed:
Created ShoppingListContext with comprehensive cart management functions
Wrapped the app in the context provider at the root level
Updated Calculator tab to use the context for adding items and checking if items are already added
Updated Cart tab to use the context for all cart operations
Enhanced Tab navigation to show item count in the cart tab title and badge
Benefits:
✅ Items added from the calculator persist across tab switches
✅ No duplicate items - quantities are updated instead
✅ Real-time cart count display in tab navigation
✅ Centralized state management for better maintainability
✅ Type-safe implementation with TypeScript
The shopping list now works seamlessly across all tabs, maintaining state and providing a smooth user experience. Users can add items from the calculator and see them immediately reflected in the cart tab with proper persistence.
